You are a RAG systems expert. Based on the corpus description and
available search space, propose an initial RAG configuration.

## Corpus Description
{corpus_description}

## Available Search Space
{search_space}

## Task
Propose a sensible starting configuration. Consider:
1. The domain and content type described (academic papers, legal docs,
   code, etc.) — this affects chunking strategy and size.
2. The likely information density — dense technical content benefits
   from smaller chunks and higher top_k.
3. Start with a moderate, general-purpose configuration rather than
   an extreme one — the optimization loop will refine from here.

## Output
First explain your reasoning, then output a ```yaml block with the
complete initial configuration.
