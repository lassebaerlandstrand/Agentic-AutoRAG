## Task
Analyze failure patterns and produce a structured Error Trace:
1. Classify each failure type: retrieval_failure | context_truncation |
   wrong_document | missing_information | hallucination | reasoning_error
2. Identify SYSTEMIC patterns across multiple failures
3. Attribute each pattern to a specific parameter or parameter interaction
4. Rate confidence: high | medium | low

Be precise and actionable. Focus on what parameter changes would fix
the most failures.
